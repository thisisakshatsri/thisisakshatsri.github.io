            You make connections and you know that he or she might leave you, because there is no other way. You Accept. You'll no longer than aquantainces. Sounds weird?<br><br>
    
            You are depressed because someone close to you had left and you constantly thinking about it. But few months back Life was pretty normal but now Life...is...just...weird.<br><br>
            
            How can someone make this much difference in very own your life?<br>
            They are crying. You are crying. You cry for them. You cry for yourself. You donâ€™t wanna accept your fate. But there is no other way. You are trapped in this shithole. So you accept.<br><br>
            
            LIFE is WEIRD.
